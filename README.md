Jetpack v0.1
=========================================

A simple Bukkit plugin which allows players to craft a jetpack. This jetpack takes the form of a piece of armor, but allows the wearer to fly. Flying damages the armor over time until it breaks.

Todo
-----------------------------------------

- add a fuel requirement, probably coal
- have lore show amount of fuel
- make warning time configurable
- output default config
- document code and config
- add onDisable to reset stuff if necessary
- move to maven

Bugs
-----------------------------------------

- when jetpack is enchanted the name begins with an unrecognized char
- when using shift-click to craft multiple jetpacks at once, only one is crafted until you click an ingredient, then the rest are crafted
